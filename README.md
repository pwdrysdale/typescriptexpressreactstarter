Something to take down some of the boilerplate.

I've spent a bit of time and done a few JS builds, now looking to use TS, but also to take down some of the boilerplate. Why not hey?

It's an express server with a react frontend created using create-react-app with the --template typescript option, and in the backend defaulting to nodemon but ts-node-dev is also baked into the cake if you want to switch accross
